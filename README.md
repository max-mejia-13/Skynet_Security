# Skynet_Security
Code repository for Skynet Security System.

Starting off a personal project in security electronics. I will implement an entire security system (password, alarm, motion detection, and locks) entirely on the MSP430G2553 microcontroller.

Based on the home security project from CDA4630 - Intro to Embedded Systems course, it will be a way to review fundamental computer architecture concepts, as well as a way to maintain a firm understanding in electronics and circuit design. 

Stage-0: Setting up an LCD display for I/O.
