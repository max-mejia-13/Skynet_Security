# Skynet_Security
Code repository for Skynet Security System.

A personal project in security electronics, I will implement an entire security system (password, alarm, motion detection, and locks) entirely on the MSP430G2553 microcontroller.

Based on the home security project from CDA4630 - Intro to Embedded Systems course, it will be a way to review fundamental computer architecture concepts, as well as a way to maintain a firm understanding in electronics and circuit design. 

## Stage-0: Setting up an LCD display for I/O.
  I will be using a 16x2 LCD to display input and output. Whether that is outputing system status, or displaying the currently typed passcode; a display is necessary to receive essentail feedback.
